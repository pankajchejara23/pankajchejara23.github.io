    "This post will explain the basics of regular expression. Regular expression (regexp in short) is a powerful technique of text searching and text manipulation. If you are planning to make your career in the field of natural language processing then regexp is a must have skill in your skill set.  \n",

    "**Example:** Every time you search in your word document using `Ctrl+f`, regular expression works in the background. \n",
